                <h1>What is a furry?</h1>
                <p>A furry, has the internet-born term that it is, has never so much as been properly defined. As is usually the case for other queer-adjacent subcultures, it's in their nature to consider a furry someone who considers themselves part of the furry community, therefore it is to be clarified that any attempts at addressing a "furry" as just someone that meets certain requirements will be highly subjective and practically not very applicable in real life, the following are just the most common ways furries already in the community have described themselves as.</p>

                <h1>Anthros?</h1>
                <p>As is commonly accepted, a furry is someone with a profound liking for anthropomorphic (often times shortened to "anthro") animals, this itself referring to a wide variety of animals that have been given human features in their portrayal, this includes but isn't limited to: ability to speak, human expressions and emotions, ability to walk on two legs, etc. There is an argument to be made about this broad definition being applicable to an immense number of fields, the ramifications of which will be covered in a future instance.</p>
