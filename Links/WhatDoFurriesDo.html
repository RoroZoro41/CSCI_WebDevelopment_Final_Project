            <h1>Fursuit</h1>
            <p>Fursuits are usually full body costumes of anthro animals, typically mammals, that a part of the furry fandom wears, usually to furcons. That is their most recognisable form, but much more common and affordable are just partial body accessories regarding head, arms, and legs anthro animal parts.</p>

            Their origin dates back to many decades ago, but it was only during the early 2000s where it first began being associated with furries. At the time, these foam structures were very primitive as they were usually either made by the people who would wear them themselves, or bought from mass producing costume companies. It was only with the appearance of specific fursuit producing business such as "Made Fur You" that the quality of fursuits increased to the point it currently is.

            Through its history, fursuit making has led the way to multiple technological advancements in an effort to improve the suits, such as certain electronic limbs and digital utilities, or even improvements regarding wearable materials.
