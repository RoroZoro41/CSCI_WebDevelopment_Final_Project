            <h1>Furry Impact</h1>
            <p>The furry community has heavily left a mark on the internet of which there are many positives and negative sides to. It has become a place for furries to share their thoughts in setting where they're likely not to get judged as much as they'd be by other non-furries just by virtue of them being furries; and it's helped them broaden their views about the world and the people that inhabit them. For some furries, the furry fandom (community) has become their family, their home, a place to belong and exist under their own terms.</p>

            <p>As opposed to this, public perception of furries has given way to waves of bullying and harrasment across the internet's history. Places such as 4chan have consolidated a strong hatred for furries that still permeates the internet realms to a degree, but which is losing impact as the furry community expands into being considered normal.</p>
