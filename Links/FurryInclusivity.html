            <h1>Furry Inclusivity</h1>
            <p>It is no secret that the furry community is essentially progressive leaning, with a higher percentage of LGBTGI+ people amongst it than in many other communities. Furries value respect and mutual love a lot, and in turn, it leads to them being generally accepting of any new individuals that would be discovering themselves as furry.</p>
            <p>It is because of that that the furry community has become essentially linked with the queer communities that it is akin to, when it comes to its public perception</p>
